  NumPy Problems
Matrix Operations: Create two random matrices and perform element-wise addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Image Processing with NumPy: Load an image as a NumPy array and apply operations like flipping, rotating, and grayscale conversion.
Statistical Analysis: Generate a dataset of 1000 random numbers and compute the mean, median, standard deviation, and variance.
           Fourier Transform: Compute the Fourier Transform of a 1D signal and visualize its frequency spectrum.
Sorting and Filtering: Generate a large random array and filter elements greater than a certain threshold.
  OpenCV Problems
Face Detection: Use OpenCV's cv2.CascadeClassifier to detect faces in an image or video.
Edge Detection: Apply the Canny edge detector on an image and visualize the results.
Object Tracking: Implement color-based object tracking using HSV color space.
Contours and Shape Detection: Extract contours from an image and classify basic shapes like circles, squares, and triangles.
Motion Detection: Detect motion in a live video feed using background subtraction.
  Matplotlib Problems
Plot a Graph: Generate and visualize a sine and cosine wave using Matplotlib.
Histogram Analysis: Plot a histogram of pixel intensities of a grayscale image.
Scatter Plot: Create a scatter plot with random data points and apply different markers.
3D Plotting: Generate a 3D surface plot for a mathematical function.
Live Data Visualization: Implement a real-time updating plot for a dynamically changing dataset.
